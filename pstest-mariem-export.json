We primarily investigate the properties of these materials using neutron scattering, a technique that allows us to investigate the magnetic ordering within these systems. Some examples of the materials I have studied include KCuF3 and Eu/Sr-doped La2CuO4 (LESCO). With KCuF3, myself and collaborators have explored the pressure dependence (on the order of GPa) of the magnetic ordering of this material in single crystals and powders. We have found that the magnetic ordering appears to be suppressed in crystals but not in powders, suggesting a uniaxial strain component with applied pressure in order to suppress magnetism. With regards to LESCO, I am currently in the process of synthesizing large single crystals of this material with the ultimate goal of exploring the mechanism of superconductivity, which is suggested to be due to BCS theory (phonon-lattice coupling); however, we intend to explore more subtleties in the underlying physics, i.e. interlayer coupling.\n",

I have conducted simulation researches for applicability of desiccant system to evaporative coolers, and operating energy saving potential was evaluated via VAV system. I also designed pilot system of LD-IDECOAS, verified system performance and energy consumption. The integration of PEM fuel cell to the proposed system to be an combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system is being progressed. The results of my research was that the proposed system can save over 60% of operating energy compared to the conventional VAV system. \n",

Using mouse models and human biopsy samples, I have found that in the low oxygen environment of the cardiac infarct, efficient macrophage clearance is required for proper tissue repair to prevent progression towards fatal heart failure. I am now studying the factors that control the balance between harmful inflammatory and helpful reparative macrophages, and how these influence the efferocytosis process. My goal is to identify therapeutic targets that may help improve patient outcomes in cardiovascular disease.\n",
